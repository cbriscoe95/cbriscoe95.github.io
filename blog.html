                <h2>On Mass Effect: Andromeda</h2>
                <h3>December 2016</h3>
                <p>With the release of Dishonored 2 and Final Fantasy XV, my next most anticipated game is Mass Effect Andromeda.</p>
 
                <p>The original Mass Effect was one of the first games I bought for my Xbox 360 and I got it for cheap at my local Family Video (remember when movie stores were a thing?!). My parents were always pretty poor when I was a kid so I had to be careful with my video game purchases. Because of this I often gravitated towards longer games with my favorite genres being RPGs. At that time, I’d known about Bioware and had played a bit of Kotor and Jade Empire, but had never sat down and played through an entire Bioware game. Playing through the first game multiple times was such a great experience for me. The game was filled to the brim with content and I got tons of hours.</p>

                <p>Then Mass Effect 2 came, although many regard Mass Effect 2 as the peak of the series, I always find myself being a little bit disappointed with my initial experience. I would describe Mass Effect 1 as more equally 50/50 shooter/rpg. Mass Effect 2 is more close to 70/30 shooter/rpg. While I can admit that Mass Effect 1 has fairly clunky minute to minute gameplay by today’s standards and Mass Effect 2 has great shooter gameplay, it lost a lot of what made the first game special. I would describe Mass Effect 2 as a better game, but a much worse RPG. That being said, the story gripped me all the way through and the Suicide Mission in the game having real, tangible consequences (Mordin died in my first playthrough of the game Q-Q) was something you don’t often see in games today.</p>

                <p>And then there’s Mass Effect 3. Oh, dear lord, Mass Effect 3. I’ve never seen such a backlash against a company after the Mass Effect 3 ending debacle. Looking at the game without the ending. Mass Effect 3 is an amazing game, probably the best game of the series. But man, does it have an absolutely. Horrible. Ending. Fraught with cliché and too much ambiguity for what is supposed to be the end of Shepard’s story.</p>
                <p>Mass Effect Andromeda however, looks like a great expansion of the Mass Effect formula and the recently released gameplay debut has me quite excited.</p>

            <p>I look forward to jumping into the series again.</p>
        
        <h2>On the Death of John Marston</h2>
        <h3>December 2016</h3>
        <p>One of my most memorable gaming experiences is the death of John Marston towards the ending of Red Dead Redemption.
        
        <p>While it’s the only way John’s story made since to end and it is probably the ending that the man deserved. It didn’t stop his sudden death before the end of the game from being so shocking. Over the course of Red Dead Redemption. You go to like John, and the man he’s trying to become. He leaves his life of crime behind and just wants to do right by his wife and son but the government has no intentions of letting bygones be bygones. Once John is no longer useful to them, he is just another loose end to be tied up.
            
        <p>After the death of John Marston, the game does not end but instead you continue the last sections of the game as John’s son, Jack. And get revenge on your father to bring a real end to the Marston story. It’s a tale of Redemption turned into a tale of revenge. As Shakespeare said in Romeo and Juliet “these violent delights have violent ends.”
        From a gameplay perspective, Rockstar did something I’d never seen before in a game and haven’t; seen since. Over the course of the game John Marston can acquire sidequests. They have their own concise stories. However, if you don’t initiate a sidequest but instead with Jack, the story and dialogue can partially change. If that wasn’t impressive enough, if you start a side quest with John but finish it with Jack then there is sometimes dialogue that reflects that choice as well. 
        <p>What an amazing level of reactivity.</p>  
            
        <h2>On the Culture of the MMO</h2>
        <h3>November 2016</h3>
        <p>I’ve played online games for as long as I’ve had a stable internet connection and a machine that could play video games.</p>
        
        <p>There is something truly wonderful about being able to share the hobby that I love with friends and strangers alike. My first love in online gaming are MOBAs, and my game of choice in this genre is League of Legends, where I’ve logged somewhere upwards of 2,000 hours although I have spent about 100 hours playing the woefully inferior DOTA 2 and a handful of other games in the genre. One genre that I had not played much of was the MMO. I wanted to dive into the genre and chose FFXIV as my introduction to the genre. I’ve enjoyed my time quite a bit and found the culture of the game quite refreshing and will continue to play. </p>
        
        <p>When starting any game I would say there are generally two types of ways that players choose avatars. There are players that want to put themselves into a game and as such create an in-game avatar that is reflective of them in some way. That avatar’s characteristics could be emblematic of the player’s physical appearance or an important part of their personality. Then, there are players (like myself) who prefer to create an interesting character first and foremost (maybe with a player created backstory in mind) and characteristics that reflect the player are a secondary concern. Because I knew I wanted to play a character class that dealt damage, I wanted to create a character that I felt was reflective of that. It impacted my experience in a way that can be pretty profound and made all of my actions feel a little bit more like my own. </p>
        
        <p>My experience interacting with players was probably the most surprising part of my time with the game.</p>
        
        <p>As a veteran of the MOBA genre, my general disposition towards strangers in a game has been a pretty negative one, players are quick to berate others in an intense player-vs-player experience. In FFXIV however, players were a lot more forgiving of rookie mistakes and although I noticed players getting upset either at me or other new players, the occurrence of this was significantly lessened when compared to a MOBA or FPS. It was a very enjoyable experience and a lot more positive than what I tend to be used to. In terms of how I interacted with players, I try very hard to not act differently than I do in real life. It is important to me to remember that the people in my games are not just NPCs but are other people and that I should treat them accordingly. If I get frustrated I generally choose to not use the in-game chat unless I’m sure I’m being constructive or helpful.</p> 
        
        <p>This game and all MMOs that follow a traditional trinity of character classes has a very established dungeon etiquette, culture, and hierarchy of tasks. In a dungeon, “tanks” are player characters that absorb damage from enemies and hold their attention or “aggro”. These players are responsible for determining the pace of the dungeon and the route that players take as they are the ones who must engage enemies first. The tank decides what enemies the players attack and in what order. The two remaining class category damage-dealing characters “DPS” (damage-per-second) and healers have their own distinct roles but to be successful they must follow the lead of the tanks in the party. In higher-level dungeons (of which I have not played yet but have watched many a livestream and YouTube video about), this ballet of player hierarchy is taken a step further then every player party has multiple players of a given category and each player must understand their role to defeat a particular “raid boss” unique encounter. As long as players were ready to follow this hierarchy of roles and tasks, quests went smoothly and players homogenized well. </p>
        
        <p>Overall, my time with FFXIV was very positive. It was interesting reflecting on my experience and seeing that I had a particular way of designing characters when given enough choice. </p>
